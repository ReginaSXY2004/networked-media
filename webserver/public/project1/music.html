    <h1 class="WhiteText">My Musical Instruments</h1>
    <p class="WhiteText">I started learning the piano when I was three, with my mom as my first teacher. She patiently guided my tiny hands over the keys, and somehow, I stuck with it.</p>
    
    <p class="WhiteText">In elementary school, I was captivated by the bright, clear sound of the flute, so I decided to learn it. Turns out, playing the flute is a workout—my face cramped up all the time, and I was constantly out of breath.</p>
    
    <p class="WhiteText">In middle school, my mom introduced me to the accordion. It was massive. Carrying it to school for a performance made me look like I was smuggling a bomb. My classmates were equal parts impressed and concerned.</p>
    
    <p class="WhiteText">Each of these instruments has shaped my musical journey, and despite the occasional oxygen deprivation and heavy lifting, I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
