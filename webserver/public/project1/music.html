    <p class="WhiteText">I started learning the piano when I was three, with my mom as my first teacher. She patiently guided my tiny hands over the keys, and somehow, I stuck with it.
    
        <br/>In elementary school, I was captivated by the bright, clear sound of the flute, so I decided to learn it. Turns out, playing the flute is a workoutâ€”my face cramped up all the time, and I was constantly out of breath.
    
        <br/>In middle school, my mom taught me the accordion. It was massive. My classmates said carrying it to school for a performance made me look like I was smuggling a bomb.
    
        <br/>Each of these instruments has shaped my musical journey. I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p>
