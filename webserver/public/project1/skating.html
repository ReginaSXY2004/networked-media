    <h1>🏆 My Skating Secret</h1>
    
    <p>When I was in kindergarten, I was on a roller-skating team—and even made it on TV! A children's channel filmed our performance, and I was the lead skater, guiding everyone through intricate obstacles. Some tricks required sharp turns, while others involved ducking under low bars at full speed.</p>

    <p>That experience became my proudest achievement—because it meant that when I first stepped onto an ice rink, I could glide effortlessly, even spinning around like a pro. Or so I thought.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to college. I was in Seattle, excited to relive my glory days on the ice. I stepped onto the rink with confidence, ready to impress. Twenty minutes later, I had fallen four times. One particularly spectacular fall sent me sliding half a meter across the ice, flat on my back. Concerned strangers gathered around me, asking, “Are you OK?” I laughed awkwardly, scrambled to my feet, and clung desperately to the rink’s edge for the rest of the session.</p>

    <p>Turns out, my former skating skills had vanished into thin air. My childhood triumphs was just a distant illusion.</p>
