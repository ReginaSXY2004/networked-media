    <h1>😊 Happy Memories: Graduation Trip</h1>
    
    <p>For our high school graduation trip, my friends and I traveled to Changsha and Xiamen. It was the happiest trip of my life.</p>

    <h2>Changsha's Spicy Delights 🌶️</h2>
    <p>We went on a food binge, devouring all kinds of spicy dishes—spicy crayfish, chopped chili fish... By the end, our tongues were completely numb, and only ice-cold Coke could keep us going.</p>

    <h2>The Tyndall Effect in Xiamen's Botanical Garden 🌿</h2>
    <p>The botanical garden felt like a dreamland. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy, casting golden beams like something straight out of a movie. Xiamen's summer heat was brutal, but the lush greenery inside the garden acted like a natural air conditioner—cool and mysterious.</p>

    <h2>Sunrise on Gulangyu Island 🌅</h2>
    <p>Our villa had a huge slide leading directly into a pool, which was already amazing. But the best memory was watching the sunrise. At 4 AM, we dragged ourselves out of bed, climbed onto the rocky shore, and waited. The sea breeze was cool, and the sky slowly shifted from deep blue to brilliant gold. In that moment, everything felt worth it.</p>

    <h2>...And a Guest We'll Never Forget 🪳</h2>
    <p>The villa also gave us an unforgettable "surprise". One day, we spotted a giant cockroach clinging to the spiral staircase on the third floor. I grabbed a can of insect spray and went all out. But instead of dying, the thing started sprinting—straight toward us! We screamed in terror, and finally, the roach fell all the way down to the first floor. A memory for life.</p>
