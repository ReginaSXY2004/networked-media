    <h1>🎣 My Fishing Plans</h1>
    
    <p>Recently, I've been obsessed with the idea of going deep-sea fishing! New York is right by the ocean, and it just feels like a missed opportunity if I don't try it at least once.</p>

    <p>I'm a total beginner. I have zero experience. But I've heard that after a fishing trip, you can cook and eat what you catch. That sounds incredibly rewarding!</p>

    <p>My roommate once went deep-sea fishing in Hawaii and had a great fun.</p>

    <p>I need some advice! Do you have any recommendations for beginner-friendly fishing spots in New York? 🧐 Also, what do I need to bring? And what's the best season to go?</p>
